Subject: Request for Work from home due to Medical leave


Dear Mr. Ganesh


This letter is for a request to work from home due to medical reasons.
I have the pelvic inflammatory disease so can't travel for next 2 months. I will try to join office before if the healing goes well.

With this letter I have attached doctor certificate for your better understanding, so please grant me to work from home for next 2 months.

I greatly value your kind deliberation in granting me to work from home.

Sincerely,

Jyoti Gaidhani
